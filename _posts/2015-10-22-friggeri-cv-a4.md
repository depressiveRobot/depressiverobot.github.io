After some years of using the [Moderncv Casual](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/moderncv-casual) LaTeX template, I wanted a fresh look for my resume. The [Friggeri CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv) immediately drew my attention. Unfortunately, it does not use the A4 paper format which is used in Germany. So I made a fork which renders in A4. In addition to that, I added a new option `nocolors` to disable the usage of colors but keeps the dark header. Feel free to grab this version from my GitHub repository [friggeri-cv-a4](https://github.com/depressiveRobot/friggeri-cv-a4). Last but not least the obligatory screenshot of the `nocolors` version:
