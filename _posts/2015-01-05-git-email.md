Every time I clone or initialize a git repository I forget to set my user name and email address. I know, I can set a default user name and email in the global `~./gitconfig`. But this doesn't work for me, because I use my Mac for work, Ph.D. related and private projects. That means I have three different email address which I mainly use.

To compensate my forgetfulness I wrote a small script which prompts me for the email address to use every time I enter `git clone` or `git init` into the command line. I think it's worth to share it with you.

First, add the following script to your `$PATH`. This script will show the prompt. **Don't forget** to change the email addresses of the array named `MAILS`.

Now the magic. Git doesn't allow us to override the `init` and `clone` command parameters. The trick is to use a shell function which overrides the `git` command and executes the above script when the specific command parameters are given:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/depressiveRobot/626e7066e77da1659c97.js"></script>

That's it. Next time you initialize or clone a repository you should see something like this:

**Update**  
_I fixed the `git` shell function to be failsafe when using options for `init` or `clone`._
